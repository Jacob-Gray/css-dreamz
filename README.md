# css-dreamz

A collection of CSS styles, built to try and combat the growing number of sites on the internet with a horrible UI. (It won't work, but we can dreamz, can we not?)

Inside this repo is a massive amount of fairly good UI elements, structures, and themes, all built around a framework-like structure.
